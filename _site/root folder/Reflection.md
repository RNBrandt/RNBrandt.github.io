-What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned a lot about margins and how to use them to move and center all the elements.  I tried to use padding and borders to position the elements as I wanted, but alas, to no avail.

- What did you learn about CSS positioning

this challenge really helped me understand the difference between absolute and relative positioning.  I feel like I understand a lot of the decoration aspects, but I spent hours and hours trying to get the links in the header to be properly positioned.  I plan on going to office hours this week to get it sorted out.

- What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

I think the design (color, font, etc...) is very easy to implement, but positioning has proven to be very frustrating as different positioning styles changed the behavior of the elements in ways I wasn't expecting.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

It's easier than I was expecting it to be!
