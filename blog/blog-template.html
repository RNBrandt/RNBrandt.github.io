1) How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was great! Having a second shot really helped me spot some issues, and I was able to bounce ideas off my partner when things didn't look right or I was stuck.

2) Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes and no,  I'm not very design oriented so it was really useful for me to have a website builder to base my work on.  Of course I'm going to build my own actual site, but I needed a great deal of help when it came to inspiration for the actual design.

3) What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

Something that is clear, clean, and functional.

4) What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

Aside, div, header, span, body.
