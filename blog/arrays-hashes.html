    <h2> Hashing Away at Arrays </h2>
    <h4>11/16/15 </h4>
    <p>
      Arrays and hashes, are two important aspects of programming.  But for some reason there’s a fair amount of confusion regarding the distinction between the two.  So we’ll start with the similarities.  Both hashes and arrays are lists of sorts, and both can be either inputs or outputs of methods.  That, however, is about where the similarities end.
    </p>
    <p>
Aside from the syntax differences, none of which are important enough to describe here.  Hashes and arrays are really quite different.  An array is an ordered list.  It can have numbers, letters, words, really anything in it.  A comma separates each item and each item can be called by its number within the array (though the first item has the 0 place).

  <p>
A hash on the other hand, is a bit more like an inventory. Imagine you’re at a car dealership and they have hatchbacks, trucks, sedans, and convertibles. Great, that’s all great info, but if you wanted to further narrow it down to blue convertibles that get greater than 30 mpg, you would could find exactly that car, if you had input all the information into a hash, and called up your desired attributes.
    <p>
And there we go, a super brief primer on the difference between hashes and arrays.  No go forth and hash away with your arrays.
