  <h3>A Classy Class in Classes</h3>

      I hope you’re all in your formal wear, ‘cause we’re about to get classy up in here!
    </p>
    <p>
      So you’ve gotten far enough to learn that Ruby is an object oriented programming language, but you can’t quite figure out what exactly an object is, or an instance, or why any of it matters at all.  Let’s see if I can help.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right off the bat, in Ruby, everything is an object, those arrays, hashes, strings, and integers you’ve been working with, all objects.  So you’ve been working with objects the whole time. Well done!
      <p>
        Now, as for classes and instances, imagine a car.  By definition a car has four wheels, a motor, breaks, and at least one seat. So the CLASS car is the Socratic Ideal Form of the thing you’re describing/ the most fundamental description that applies to every INSTANCE of that class.  If we wanted to make a class of motor vehicles and include motorcycles and those weird motorized skateboards, we can do that, in which case car becomes an instance of motor vehicles
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving the other direction, what makes your car your car?  You do have a lovely 1995 bubblegum pink Kia Sorrento with that awesome millennium falcon bumper sticker after all.  That’s much more specific than the description for the CLASS car, so to describe your vehicle you would go into the car CLASS which means it has: four wheels, a motor, breaks, and at least one seat, and create an INSTANCE for your car with bubblegum pink paint, millennium falcon sticker, Make Kia, model Sorrento.

        I know this seems like weird arbitrary distinctions, but just wait for next week where we’ll see how this all comes together!
      </p>
      <p>til then… (you know what I’m going to say)…. ….. Keep it CLASSY!!!</p></h4>
